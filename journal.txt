# Today is Tuesday. I will go home on Friday. I am a teacher, and I will be working at my school until Fridya.
On Friday, I will drive home with my son and my wife. It will take us 3 hours to get home.


!!!!! In English we do not string verbs together like thi(drive...bring...go...)
!!!!! note: Don't need to say drive my car. the verb drive already implies a car.


# Today is wednesday, Octorber 29th, 2025. Cloudy.

  Okay. Today I will describe what I do. I'm a teacher. I am a primary school teacher. I teach math and Chinese, along with other subjects if the school requires it.
  My school is very far away and remote. The living conditions are very poor. But I have no choice. This is life. I need the job to make a living. So, actually, I don't like my job at all.
