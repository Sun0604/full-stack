# Today is Tuesday. I will go home on Friday. I am a teacher, and I will be working at my school until Fridya.
On Friday, I will drive home with my son and my wife. It will take us 3 hours to get home.


!!!!! In English we do not string verbs together like thi(drive...bring...go...)
!!!!! note: Don't need to say drive my car. the verb drive already implies a car.
